This example repository is used to check commit messages.
When committing files into the repository, a certain text form is expected. If this text form is not correct,
an error message will be displayed and a commit will not be allowed until the error is corrected.

The form for commit messages is as follows:

<type>:<description> with a length between 1 and 50 characters.

<type>
feature (new feature)
fix (bug fix)
refactor (refactoring code)
wip (work in progress - commits to be pushed later)

<description>
Custom text (length 1-50 chars)
